# Udemy-clone
A front-end clone of the Udemy learning platform built using HTML and CSS. This project replicates the core design and layout of Udemyâ€™s homepage, including navigation, course listings, banners, and responsive UI. The goal of this project is to practice front-end development skills and create a visually appealing user interface.
